Note:
	Extra personality if you prefer:
		- Transparency bar: set the background color to the #00000000 (alpha code in hex)
		- Cleaner neofetch: edit the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/neofetch/config.conf
		- Also if you don't like to set up something, just remove it :))) (wish you can btw)
	I use Arch, that's why this setup may not work on other machine
	I cannot use glx because it's laggy. That's why my rounded window seems kinda ugly.
	And also, nothing special anyway
